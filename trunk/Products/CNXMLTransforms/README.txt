CNXMLTransforms

  This Zope Product is part of the Rhaptos system
  (http://software.cnx.rice.edu)
  
  This package of PortalTransforms-type transforms allows you
  to convert several other formats to CNXML.

  OOoTransform (by way, currently, of the OOoTransformTool)
  allows you to convert OpenOffice and Microsoft Word
  files into CNXML documents and associated Image objects.

  The conversion will have the best results if you use the Styles
  feature from Word or OpenOffice to mark your content.  The importer
  recognizes Headings, Links, and Code by default.  You can also use
  the following Word template that includes styles for CNXML inline
  tags: http://cnx.rice.edu/help/authoring/templates/Connexions-Document.dot

  AuthenticTransform is a like-type tranfsform that makes CNXML
  generated by the Authentic tool suitable for a CNXMLDocument.
  
Requirements:

  * CNXML Document

  * UniFile
  
  * PortalTransforms and MimetypesRegistry
  
  For OOoTransform:
  
    * A recent version of the Java Runtime Engine (required for OpenOffice)
      http://java.com/

    * OpenOffice.org 1.1.X
      http://download.openoffice.org/

      NOTE: OpenOffice.org 2.0 will not work!

    * The HTML tidy library
      http://tidy.sourceforge.net/libintro.html

    * Python bindings for libtidy
      http://download.berlios.de/utidylib/uTidylib-0.2.zip

  For XHTMLTransform:
  
    * Connexions packaging of MathML 2.0
      http://rhaptos.org/downloads/xml/mathml/

Installation

  OOoTransform depends on OpenOffice running in a background
  server process to convert Microsoft Word documents.  To set this up
  you must:

  * Install OpenOffice in single-user mode and grant write permission
    on the installation to whatever user your Zope process runs as.

  * Somewhere in the executable path create a symlink to
    'program/python.sh' under your OpenOffice installation and name it
    'oopython'. The Debian package for OOo doesn't have this.

  * Launch the OpenOffice server with the command: 
    'oowriter "-accept=socket,host=localhost,port=2002;urp;"'

  Note that as of this time, openoffice cannot run "headless" and
  requires an X server running.  If your machine does not have an X
  server running you can use the virtual server Xvfb.  For an example
  of how to use this see 'Extension/oolaunch'

  You can test that your OpenOffice server is functioning by running
  'CNXMLTransforms/Extension/ooconvert.py input.doc > output.sxc'
  where input.doc is some Microsoft Word file.
  
  The product installs as part of the Rhaptos package.

Future plans

  - More transforms
  
  - Could probably stand to do a little re-organizing of helper files
  
  - Published modules, courses
